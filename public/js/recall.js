//this will be an active recall test
//while loop that runs until user solution is wrong
//display shapes to user, then prompt them to recall what shape it is
//each level of test is array of shapes (easy: 3 shape, medium: 4 shape: hard: 5 shape)

//original array before randomized
['triangle', 'square', 'circle']

//if user answers match in correct order, move on to next round
['square', 'circle', 'triangle']


//have a list of clickable shapes
//if they click a shape, push that shape to answer array
//innerHTML of that element would now be everything in the answer array
